Determine two things:
1) Where we are spending the least amount of money buying the exact same product that will help us to determine where we want to shop?
2) Should I buy all the products at the same place or are there certain products that they are going to be cheaper at a specific store and i should buy it there?

Now we know that Costco is the place to go for basically every single product except if we're buying rice and if we want to save just a few dollars we're going to head over to Target and this will change my shopping habits for the next several years until the apocalypse happens.
